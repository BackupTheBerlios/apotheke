  
                      Apotheke CVS View
                      =================

  0. Introduction
  ---------------

Apotheke is _not_ a standalone program. It is designed as a 3rd party view (a
kind of plugin) for the Gnome 2.0 file manager Nautilus[1], so this is an
inherent requirement. Apotheke provides an alternative directory view for CVS
managed directories within Nautilus. You have direct access to CVS commands
from the Nautilus menu and can browse the CVS status for each file visually.

In it's current state, Apotheke is not a fully working CVS environment. But you
can manage and work with already existing CVS directories. The option to
checkout or create new repositories will be added in the future eventually.


  1. Requirements
  ---------------

As already stated above you need the Nautilus file manager installed, which
requries a fairly complete installation of the Gnome2 development platform[2].
Apotheke itself depends only on the following packages:

 o gtk2
 o gnome-vfs
 o libnautilus
 o libgnome
 o gconf
 o libglade
 o fam (optional)

The optional fam library should provide automatic file modification feedback
(but it doesn't yet ;).


  2. Installation
  ---------------

Compile Apotheke and install it into the same prefix as the rest of your Gnome2
desktop. Now start Nautilus and go to a CVS directory you want to
browse. Select "View as other ..." from the drop-down box in the toolbar, which
pops up a new dialog. If everything goes well there should be a "View as CVS"
entry in the presented list now. Select it and press Ok.


  3. Further Information
  ----------------------

The official Apotheke homepage is located at 
   
   http://apotheke.berlios.de. 

There you can always find the latest releases and instructions how to access
the bleeding edge sourcecode directly from CVS.
